# 🍪 Cookie Cutter Bot

This project is a Python-based automation script using Selenium that plays the [Cookie Clicker game experiment](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie) in Google Chrome.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this bot is to **automate and optimize gameplay** to see how many **cookies per second** it can achieve over a fixed session of **5 minutes**. It simulates rapid clicking on the cookie and intelligent purchasing of upgrades to maximize cookie generation.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Chrome WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

## 🚀 Features

- Auto-clicks the main cookie as fast as possible
- Automatically buys upgrades and products based on cost-benefit optimization
- Tracks performance over a 5-minute interval
- Reports final cookies per second (CPS) score

The bot will:
- Launch Chrome and navigate to the game
- Play the game automatically for 5 minutes
- Print out the final cookies per second (CPS)

## 🧪 Why This?

This project is a fun experiment in browser automation, resource optimization, and real-time decision-making. It's a simple, visual way to apply automation logic using Selenium in Python.

## 📊 Example Output

```
cookies/second : 83
```
